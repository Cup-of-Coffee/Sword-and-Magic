  <h2>The Podcast</h2>
  <p>This podcast is a collection of me and my friends playing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons"> fantasy tabletop campaign</a>. We are playing a 
  different verison called Pathfinder, but the spirit and idea is still the same. This podcast covers all of the campaigns, something like the entire story of a book, that 
  we play through and experience.</p>
  <h2>The Crew</h2>
  <h3>Larry</h3>
  <p>The owner and maintainer of the website. I am also the guy currently editing the videos until GT gets to it himself. I am the fellow who play characters that try to get a 
  laugh and smile out of everyone, and brighten the mood when things start to look dire.</p>
  <h3>GT</h3>
  <p>Our generous and totally not tyrantical Dungeon Master. He creates and runs all of the game himself and has been doing so for quite some time, amassing a great skill and 
  talent at telling stories with his own twist and flair. While his stories often are dark and lead to despair, in such place heroism and greatness can be achieved.</p>
  <h3>Jack</h3>
  <p>Our charismatic leader and fearless champion. He is a incredibe speaker and is confident in his abilities. He is the man known for his character arcs and attempts at 
  interweaving with other NPC's relationships, to amazing, terrific, but always interesting results.
  </p>
  <h3>Lucros</h3>
  <p>If the phrase "Speak softly and carry a big stick" can describe a person, it would be Lucros. He rarely speaks, but when he does, it's for something important, and when he
  does something, he has a plan in mind. Now if only he wasn't so blinded by his own greed of anything that's shiny.
  </p>
  <h3>RA</h3>
  <p>While he may not pay attention to things like names and places, he does still have heart and the occasional sparkle of brilliance when doing things, that lend itself to
  great dyamnics and dramtic outcomes. </p>
  <h2>The Current Party</h2>

  <h2>Other Examples of Games</h2>
  If you are still unsure of what a tabletop game is, then I could give the suggestion of checking out of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpXBGqwsBkpvcYjsJBQ7LEQ">
  Critical Role</a> Youtube channel made up of famous voice-actors, where they host episodes of their high-production campaign runned by Matt Mercer.
  <br><br>
  As well, if you're intersted in running your own game, all you need to do is go buy a book. The <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/">Wizard of the Coast</a> website has several 
  for the newest edition of Dungeon and Dragons, 5th Edition.
